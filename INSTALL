Uhm, no easy install yet

1. Edit vmailadmin.pl and change configuration session to suit your needs

2. If using mysql log (by now it's useless, but will become important) create and setup appropriate users, tables and db.
Log table should be like:
create table vmailadmin ( id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL, user VARCHAR(31), domain varchar(255), ip VARCHAR(15), time INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL, action VARCHAR(31), target VARCHAR(31), PRIMARY KEY(id), INDEX(time));
The user you configured in vmailadmin.pl must have select and insert priviliges into this table

3. Copy vmaildmin.pl and templates dir to some directory.
Insert into httpd.conf an scriptalias or alias + .htaccess as you like

4. If you haven't got perl patch against suidperl exploit, get it now.
Search www.securityfocus.com for suidperl for more info.

5. Set suid bit:
chown root.root vmailadmin.pl
chmod 4755 vmailadmin.pl

6. Certify suidperl is suid
chmod 4755 /usr/bin/suidperl

7. Test it.

8. Drink a beer or a milk or whatever

If it doesn't work, read again the instalation and try it again.
If not works anyway, send me an email (davi@sourceforge.net) and try to help
you as much as I can.
