Uhm, no easy install yet

1. Edit vmailadmin.pl and change configuration session to suit your needs

2. Install perl modules that are needed. The hardest will be 
vpopmail.pm. You can fetch it at
ftp://ftp.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/S/SS/SSCANLON/vpopmail-0.02.tar.gz
It doesn't compile cleanly with new versions of vpopmail. You can
find a dirty patch to make it work at http://vmailadmin.sourceforge.net
!Be aware that calling vadddomain within perl after applying this patch
may generate a security flaw!
I promess I'll write a new module for vpopmail as soon as I can

3. If using mysql log create and setup appropriate users, tables and db.
Log table should be like:
create table vmailadmin ( id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL, user VARCHAR(31), domain varchar(255), ip VARCHAR(15), time INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL, action VARCHAR(31), target VARCHAR(31), PRIMARY KEY(id), INDEX(time));
The user you configured in vmailadmin.pl must have select and insert priviliges into this table

4. Copy vmaildmin.pl and templates dir to some directory.
Insert into httpd.conf an scriptalias or alias + .htaccess as you like

5. If you haven't got perl patch against suidperl exploit, get it now.
Search www.securityfocus.com for suidperl for more info.

6. Set suid bit:
chown root.root vmailadmin.pl
chmod 4755 vmailadmin.pl

7. Certify suidperl is suid
chmod 4755 /usr/bin/suidperl

8. Test it.

9. Drink a beer or a milk or whatever

If it doesn't work, read again the instalation and try it again.
If it still doesn't work edit the script and turn $DEBUG=1. It might help.
Take a look at common problems some people has found.
If it still doesn't work, drop me an email and I'll try my best.


10. Some common problems:

10.1 Can't install vpopmail.pm!
Apply the patch I told in item 2 or just take a look at it and do yourself.
If using mysql, edit it Makefile including -lmysqlclient and -L/usr/mysql/libs
or relevant path.

10.2 I enter www.domain.com/vmailadmin and when I try to log I end at www.otherdomain.com/vmailadmin

Be sure UseCanonicalNames is on in httpd.conf
Remember <VirtualHost> syntax has changed in apache 1.3 It should be
<VirtualHost 192.168.0.1> not <VirtualHost www.domain.com>

10.3 Everything works but I can't login!
Turn on debugging and if everything seems correct except that _enc_authenticate
returns 0, them probably your script can't access vpasswd.cdb
Recheck suidbits for vmailadmin.cgi and suidperl. Some distros, as SuSE,
change suidperl suidbit without telling you. If it is the case, look at
/etc/permissions.*
